# Chowtime

Friends, colleagues, and significant others alike all face a similar problem day in and day out: "What are we going to eat?" Indecisiveness and disagreement take the front seat as groups spend more time trying to figure out what to eat than they do actually eating. What if there was a way to take the decision aspect out of the process and get right to chowing down? Well, there's an app for that.

Chowtime is a mobile App built using React Native, that utilizes the Yelp Fusion API to decide on a restaurant for you! Just provide a few search criteria and let Chowtime handle the rest. Don't like the suggestion? It'll give you another one until you do. It even gives you the option to call an Uber straight to the restaurant. Now, deciding what to eat can be as simple as opening an app!
